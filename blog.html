        <h3>📊 How I Built My Portfolio Website</h3>
        <p>Creating my personal portfolio website was a rewarding experience where I brought together skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal was to design a clean, professional site that reflects my background in data analytics and tech.</p>

        <p><strong>🔧 Technologies Used:</strong><br>
        - <strong>HTML & CSS:</strong> Structured the content and styled the layout using clean and responsive design.<br>
        - <strong>JavaScript:</strong> Handled interactivity and dynamic behavior like active menu highlighting.<br>
        - <strong>Git & GitHub:</strong> Managed version control and hosted the website using GitHub Pages.<br>
        - <strong>VS Code:</strong> My development environment of choice, great for writing and managing code.</p>

        <p><strong>🧱 Page Structure:</strong><br>
        - <strong>Home Page:</strong> Short intro with a call to action.<br>
        - <strong>About Me:</strong> Highlights my skills, tools, education, and work history.<br>
        - <strong>Projects:</strong> Each project is presented with a title, short description, and a file access button.<br>
        - <strong>Blog:</strong> This page! Used to document my journey, share insights, and track growth.</p>

        <p><strong>💡 What I Learned:</strong><br>
        - Importance of clean UI and consistent layout.<br>
        - GitHub Pages is an easy and free way to publish your site.<br>
        - Writing modular HTML/CSS makes it easier to manage multiple pages.</p>

        <p><strong>🌐 Deployment:</strong><br>
        I pushed all my files to a GitHub repo and enabled GitHub Pages under the <code>Settings > Pages</code> tab. The main branch with the root folder served as the source, making my portfolio live and shareable with anyone.</p>
